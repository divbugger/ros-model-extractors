**Description**
I have tried the model extractor (the HAROS plugin to obtain automatically models compatible with the RosTooling) but it has not been able to obtain the model or the model obtained is not correct.

The input information I have given has been:
- Package name:
- Artifact name (executable in in CMakeLists.txt):
- Distro:
- URL of the repository in Git:
- Branch:

I used:
- [ ] The web interface (http://ros-model.seronet-project.de/)
- [ ] The direct command to call the analysis in a Docker container.

(In case of using the direct command) This was executed command :
```
docker run -it ....
```

The result of the analysis was the following:
```

```
